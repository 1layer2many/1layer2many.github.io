# subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me

Hi! My name is **Suvobrat Ghosh**, or simply, **Shuvam**. I'm a computer programmer by profession and a machine learning enthusiast at heart. When I'm not busy at work (which is very often), I like to do a lot of stuff:

- I like to prepare delicacies
- I like to play football
- I like to read books while sipping a cuppa coffee
- I love speedcubing
- I like to go out on long rides, preferrably on 2 wheelers
- I love sketching
- I like to play guitar while humming my favorite tunes
- I love creating memes

### My bucket list

To be honest, I've a not-so-terribly-long bucket list of things that I wanna do:

- Skating
- Gliding
- Scuba diving
- Bungee jumping
- Snowboarding among other things...

Watch out this space for more on my adventures...
